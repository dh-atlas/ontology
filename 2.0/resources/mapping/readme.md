# About

The ATLAS data model is composed of six main classes:

1. Research Project;
2. Research Product (and its subclasses: Digital Scholarly Edition; Linked Open Data; Ontology; Software; Text Collection; Language Model; 3D Digital Twin);
3. Person;
4. Organization;
5. Computer Program;
6. Web Site.

The classes and properties listed above were selected through a mapping of various existing models, specifically:

- [RO-crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.1/index.html);
- OpenAIRE ([Graph](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/) and [Application Profile](https://guidelines.openaire.eu/en/latest/literature/application_profile.html));
- [SKG IF](https://skg-if.readthedocs.io/en/latest/);
- IRIS;
- [KNOT](https://icdp-digital-library.github.io/KNOT/website/ENG/data_model.html).

Following the selection of classes and properties, the ATLAS data model was constructed based on three main existing models: [schema.org](https://schema.org/), [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) and [FaBiO](https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html).

These files represent the outcome of the mapping process and the resulting ATLAS data model.
